## Open-Ended Questions

1. ### What is Node.js? Where can you use it?

   **What is Node.js?**
   - Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment and library to run web applications outside the client’s browser. 
   - It uses an asynchronous, event-driven model.
   - It is used to create server-side web applications.

   **Where can you use it?**
   - Data-intensive applications,
   - I/O intensive web applications like video streaming sites,
   - Real-time web applications, 
   - Network applications, 
   - General-purpose applications,
   - Distributed systems.

**[ Back to Top ⬆ ](#open-ended-questions)**

2. ### Why use Node.js?

   - It is generally fast
   - It rarely blocks
   - It offers a unified programming language and data type
   - Everything is asynchronous 
   - It yields great concurrency

**[ Back to Top ⬆ ](#open-ended-questions)**

3. ### Why is Node.js Single-threaded?

      Node.js is single-threaded for async processing. By doing async processing on a single-thread under typical web loads, more performance and 
      scalability can be achieved instead of the typical thread-based implementation.

**[ Back to Top ⬆ ](#open-ended-questions)**

4. ### If Node.js is single-threaded, then how does it handle concurrency?

      The Node.js Processing paradigm is heavily influenced by the JavaScript Event-based model and the JavaScript callback system. As a result,
      Node.js can easily manage more concurrent client requests. The event loop is the processing model's beating heart in Node.js.

**[ Back to Top ⬆ ](#open-ended-questions)**

5. ### Explain callback in Node.js.

      A callback function is called after a given task. It allows other code to be run in the meantime and prevents any blocking. 
      _All APIs of Node are written to support callbacks._

**[ Back to Top ⬆ ](#open-ended-questions)**

6. ### What are the advantages of using promises instead of callbacks?

   - The control flow of asynchronous logic is more specified and structured.
   - The coupling is low.
   - We've built-in error handling.
   - Improved readability.

**[ Back to Top ⬆ ](#open-ended-questions)**

7. ### How would you define the term I/O?

      The term I/O is used to describe any program, operation, or device that transfers data to or from a medium and to or from another medium

**[ Back to Top ⬆ ](#open-ended-questions)**

8. ### What does event-driven programming mean?

      An event-driven programming approach uses events to trigger various functions. An event can be anything, such as typing a key or clicking 
      a mouse button. A call-back function is already registered with the element executes whenever an event is triggered.

**[ Back to Top ⬆ ](#open-ended-questions)**

9. ### What is an Event Loop in Node.js?

      Event loops handle asynchronous callbacks in Node.js. It is the foundation of the non-blocking input/output in Node.js, making it one of the most important environmental features.

**[ Back to Top ⬆ ](#open-ended-questions)**

10. ### What is an EventEmitter in Node.js?

   - EventEmitter is a class that holds all the objects that can emit events
   - Whenever an object from the EventEmitter class throws an event, all attached functions are called upon synchronously

**[ Back to Top ⬆ ](#open-ended-questions)**

11. ### What are the two types of API functions in Node.js?

      The two types of API functions in Node.js are:

      - Asynchronous, non-blocking functions
      - Synchronous, blocking functions

**[ Back to Top ⬆ ](#open-ended-questions)**

12. ### What is the package.json file?

      This file holds the metadata for a particular project.

**[ Back to Top ⬆ ](#open-ended-questions)**

13. ### What are streams in Node.js?

      Streams are objects that enable you to read data or write data continuously. There are four types of streams:

      - **Readable** – Used for reading operations
      - **Writable** − Used for write operations
      - **Duplex** − Can be used for both reading and write operations
      - **Transform** − A type of duplex stream where the output is computed based on input

14. ### What is REPL in Node.js?

      REPL stands for _Read Eval Print Loop_, and it represents a computer environment.
      The shell **reads** JavaScript code the user enters, **eval**uates the result of interpreting the line of code, 
      **prints** the result to the user, and **loops** until the user signals to quit.

15. ### What is the control flow function?

      The control flow function is a piece of code that runs in between several asynchronous function calls.

**[ Back to Top ⬆ ](#open-ended-questions)**

16. ### What is the buffer class in Node.js?

      Buffer class stores raw data similar to an array of integers but corresponds to a raw memory allocation outside the V8 heap.
      Buffer class is used because pure JavaScript is not compatible with binary data

**[ Back to Top ⬆ ](#open-ended-questions)**

17. ### What is callback hell?

   - Callback hell, also known as the pyramid of doom, is the result of intensively nested, unreadable, and unmanageable callbacks, 
   which in turn makes the code harder to read and debug
   - improper implementation of the asynchronous logic causes callback hell

**[ Back to Top ⬆ ](#open-ended-questions)**

18. ### Explain the concept of middleware in Node.js.

      Middleware is a function that receives the request and response objects. Most tasks that the middleware functions perform are:  

      - Execute any code
      - Update or modify the request and the response objects
      - Finish the request-response cycle
      - Invoke the next middleware in the stack

**[ Back to Top ⬆ ](#open-ended-questions)**

19. ### Are there any disadvantages to using Node.js?

      Node.js is not suitable for applications that require a lot of memory. This is because Node.js uses a lot of memory for each connection. 

**[ Back to Top ⬆ ](#open-ended-questions)**

20. ### What is the primary reason for using the event-based model in Node.js?

      The main reason to use the event-based model in Node.js is performance. The event-based model allows for non-blocking I/O operations, 
      which means that Node.js can handle a large number of connections without using a lot of resources.

**[ Back to Top ⬆ ](#open-ended-questions)**

21. ### Can you access DOM in Node?

      No, you cannot access the DOM in Node.js. The DOM is a browser-specific API that allows for the manipulation of HTML and XML documents. 
      Since Node.js does not run in a browser, it does not have access to the DOM.

**[ Back to Top ⬆ ](#open-ended-questions)**

22. ### What are global objects in Node.js?

      Global objects in Node.js are objects that are available in all modules without the need for an explicit require statement. 
      Some of the most commonly used global objects in Node.js include **process**, **console**, and **buffer**.
